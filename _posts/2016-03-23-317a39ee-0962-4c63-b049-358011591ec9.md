Writing a fantasy novel

Writing a fantasy novel by the seat of my pants was a good re-start as an author. It was my first fiction, though, and it was a very different experience. Previously I had written articles, non-fiction chapters in compilations, and technical documents. 

However, I've learned the values of outlining and of writing in sprints. Finding the right time of day to set a routine and enlisting the help of my partner for sessions of reading-out-loud has been really helpful to move the story along. Finishing the first novel and getting it published was quite a hurdle, but entirely worth the learning curve.
